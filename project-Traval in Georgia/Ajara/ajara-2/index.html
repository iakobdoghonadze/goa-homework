    <p>Adjara has been part of Georgian polities      since ancient times, influenced by Greek, Roman, and later Byzantine rule. It became part of the Kingdom of Abkhazia in the 8th century and contributed to Georgia’s unification in the 11th century. Christianity was introduced early, with Andrew the Apostle believed to have preached there first.

        The region was ruled by the Persians, Seljuks, Mongols, and Timurids before being conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1614. Under Ottoman rule, most Adjarians converted to Islam. In 1878, the Russian Empire annexed Adjara, leading to some emigration to Turkey.

        Following Georgia’s brief independence (1918–1921), Adjara became an autonomous republic within Soviet Georgia due to its Muslim population. During Soviet rule, religious practices declined, and Adjarians remained culturally Georgian.

        After Georgia’s independence in 1991, Aslan Abashidze ruled Adjara with increasing authoritarianism. Following the Rose Revolution in 2003, Mikheil Saakashvili reasserted Georgian control, and Abashidze fled to Moscow in 2004.

        Today, Adjara remains an autonomous region within Georgia, with economic and cultural influences from both Turkey and Russia.
