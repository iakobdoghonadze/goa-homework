                <p class="p2">Samegrelo ( Megrelian: Samargalo) is a historical and geographical region of Western Georgia . 
            It is the territory between the Rioni , Tskhenistskali , Enguri rivers and the Black Sea . 
            The name comes from the name of the historical region Egrisi . 
            It has been mentioned in Georgian written sources since the 12th century . 
            Initially, it was identified with the entire Western Georgia (similar to Abkhazia , Imereti ), 
            in the 13th - 15th centuries it already had a narrow meaning - it refers to the area inhabited by the ethnographic 
            group of Georgians - the Megrelians - between the rivers Psitsrkha (ancient Anakodiistskali) and Tskhenistskali . 
            The central city is Zugdidi .

            In the late Middle Ages, the Principality of Odishi was created in this territory , and it received a new name from it
             - Odishi , although foreign sources also contain names derived from "Samegrelo". In the first half of the 19th century,
              the name "Samegrelo" was again established in literature. In the first half of the 17th century , as a result of the 
              oppression of Abkhaz feudal lords, over time, the border of the principality first moved to the Kelasuri River , then 
              to the Galidzga , and finally to the Enguri

                <p class="p2">Martvili Canyon is a canyon in Georgia , in the Martvili Municipality . 
                    [ 1 ] It is located near the village of Gachedili , in the Abasha River gorge, on the 
                    Martvili-Chkhorotsku central highway, at an altitude of 210 m above sea level . [ 2 ]

                    It is a canyon-like valley cut by the Abasha River in the Abdati limestone anticline . 
                    The canyon is 2,400 m long, 20-30 m deep, and 5-10 m wide. In two places, natural limestone bridges have been preserved in the canyon, indicating that a karst cave once collapsed here. [ 2 ]
                    
                    In addition, small waterfalls with a drop of 12-15 m arise in the middle of the canyon .
                    
                    One section is distinguished by its special beauty. This is Ofutskhole, known as the "Dadiani Baths". 
                    
                    To get there, the path follows a staircase built of large limestone blocks. The flora characteristic of the Colchian
                     forest is developed on the surrounding limestone rocks , with its unique representatives, including: datvistkhila ,
                      Colchian boxwood , utgohari and others. There are many different types of mosses and ferns . [ 2 ]
                    
                    Martvili Canyon is one of the most popular protected areas . The Martvili Canyon Visitor Center is
                     located in the village of Didi Inchkhuri , at the entrance to the canyon. A 700 m long circular stone-paved
                      hiking trail starts from the visitor center and follows the Dadiani Historical Trail. The trail features 2 
                      bridges , 3 viewing platforms, and a 30-step historic staircase built of large limestone boulders. [ 3 ]</p>
