   <h1 style="color: chartreuse;">tutorial how to cook a bomb jk hw to make a website</h1>

<p>ok so i will show an example and then explain how to do what i show</p>
<h1>this is a headline (or h for short)</h1>
<p>to make the headline you need to use a command h1 or h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 <br> and you might ask why so many commands for a thing so small <br>and that is because the higher the h is the text gets smaller <br>and now ill show you some examples of them</p>
<h2>this is h2</h2>
<h3>this is h3</h3>
<h4>this is h4</h4>
<h5>this is h5</h5>
<h6>this is h6</h6>
<p>ok lets get on explaining what im currently using to explain <br> a paragraph or  as in a command p and another <br> thing you can use in a p is br <br> wich is short for line break</p>
<p>ok lets explain how to make a <button style="color: red;">button</button></p>
<p>to make a button we neeed a command button and to display text inside of it we just type in the command </p>
<p>ok lets move on to images </p>
<img src="images.png"  width="125" >
<p>to display an image we need a command img and the image you want to display <br> we type the image's name in the src="" between the "" <br> but the image has to be in the same folder otherwise it wont work
</p>
<p>we can also make text and the background colored </p>
<p>same as this</p>

    <p>we can also do <i>this</i> also <b>this</b> and <u>this</u> <br> for the italic one we need to put the text in a command i bold is b and under line is u </p>


    
<p> we can also make the bacground look diferent color or the text <br>
and to do this we need to type style and then color in the p/h1 and the color we want in the color: ; </p>
